Workflow
1) Clone the git repo and MAKE A SEPARATE BRANCH FOR YOUR CURRENT ISSUE!
2) In terminal, run: py -3 -m http.server
3) Go to http://localhost:8000/ or whichever port it creates
4) Go to /src
5) To see changes, save your code and press ctrl + f5 on the localhost page to hard refresh. This redownloads all the files to ensure every file is up to date.
